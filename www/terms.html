Please also remember that all use of the OTR website and service is subject to the OTR Terms of Service.</p><p><b>7 INDEMNIFICATION</b></p><p>7.1 You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us, our affiliates and licensors, each of our and their business partners (including third party sellers on websites operated by or on behalf of us) and each of our and their respective employees, officers, directors and representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), arising out of or in connection with any claim arising out of: (i) Your use of the Services, OTR Properties and/or OTR Marks in a manner not authorized by this Agreement and/or in violation of the applicable restrictions, the Acceptable Use Policy and/or applicable law; (ii) Your Application, Your Content or the combination of either with other Applications, content or processes, including but not limited to any claim involving infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights and/or the use, development, design, manufacture, production, advertising, promotion and/or marketing of Your Application and/or Your Content; (iii) Your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy or any applicable additional policies, including without limitation, Your representations and warranties;, or (iv) You or Your employees’ or personnel’s negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>7.2 We agree to promptly notify You of any claim subject to indemnification; provided that our failure to promptly notify You shall not affect Your obligations hereunder except to the extent that our failure to promptly notify You delays or prejudices Your ability to defend the claim. At our option, You will have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of Your own choosing (subject to our written consent) and to settle such claim as You deem appropriate, provided that You shall not enter into any settlement without our prior written consent and provided that we may, at any time, elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of the claim.</p><p><b>8. DISPUTES</b></p><p>8.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of OTR’s or any third party’s intellectual property rights and/or proprietary rights. You further acknowledge that our rights in the OTR Services, OTR Properties and the OTR Marks are of a special, unique, extraordinary character, giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be readily estimated and may not be adequately compensated for in monetary damages.</p><p>8.2 By using the Services, You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between You and us.</p><p>8.3 Arbitration. You and OTR both agree to resolve disputes only by arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and the procedures may be different, but an arbitrator can award you the same damages and relief, and must honor the same terms in this agreement, as a court would. If the law allows for an award of attorney’s fees, an arbitrator can award them too. You and OTR also both agree that:</p><ul><li>8.3.1 The federal arbitration act applies to this agreement. Any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of this agreement or from any services you receive from us will be resolved by one or more neutral arbitrators before the american arbitration association (“AAA”). You can also bring any issues you may have to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies, and if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.<br></li><li>8.3.2 Unless you and OTR agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California. You can get procedures, rules and fee information from the aaa (<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adr.org%2F&amp;t=YjA3YzhlZTFkNjdiNzZhYzQ3NTU3OTQwYjgxMWIwMmJkNDBhZGYyOSxUbG1CR21jVQ%3D%3D">www.Adr.Org</a>) or from us.<br></li><li>8.3.3 This agreement doesn’t allow class or collective arbitrations even if the aaa procedures or rules would. Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the arbitrator may award money or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. No class or representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this agreement.<br></li><li>8.3.4 If either you or OTR intends to seek arbitration under this agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to OTR should be sent as required by this agreement. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If you and OTR are unable to resolve our dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.<br></li><li>8.3.5 An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it can’t be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.<br></li><li>8.3.6 If for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in subsection 8.3.3 Cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply.<br></li><li>8.3.7 If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and OTR agree that there will not be a jury trial. You and OTR unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this agreement in any way. In the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court. You and OTR also agree that any dispute hereunder shall be adjudicated in any state or federal court in San Franicsco, California, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<br></li></ul><p><b>9.
